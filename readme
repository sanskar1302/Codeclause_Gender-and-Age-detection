# Real-time Age and Gender Estimation

This project uses OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models to perform real-time age and gender estimation from a webcam feed. It detects faces in the video feed, estimates the age and gender of each detected face, and overlays the results on the video.

## How it works

The `faceBox` function is used to detect faces in the video frame using the OpenCV deep neural network (DNN) module. It then crops the detected faces and feeds them into separate pre-trained age and gender classification models.

The pre-trained models used in this project are as follows:
- Face Detection Model: `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`, `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`
- Age Classification Model: `age_deploy.prototxt`, `age_net.caffemodel`
- Gender Classification Model: `gender_deploy.prototxt`, `gender_net.caffemodel`

The age is classified into the following groups:
- (0-2)
- (4-6)
- (8-12)
- (15-20)
- (25-32)
- (38-43)
- (48-53)
- (60-100)

The gender is classified as either "Male" or "Female".

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have OpenCV installed in your Python environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Python script `age_gender_estimation.py`.
3. The webcam feed will open, and faces will be detected in real-time.
4. The age and gender of each detected face will be displayed on the video.
